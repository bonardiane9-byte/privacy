  <h1>Privacy Policy for Daily Routine</h1>
  <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for using <strong>Daily Routine</strong>. This privacy policy explains how we handle information within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The Daily Routine app does <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from users.
    All routines, progress, and preferences you create are stored locally on your device only.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Local Storage Only</h2>
  <p>
    Your routines and schedules are saved in your phoneâ€™s local storage and are never transmitted to any remote servers.
    Deleting the app will remove all stored data from your device.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The app may request basic system permissions (such as notifications) to help remind you about your daily routines.
    These permissions are optional and are used only for your convenience.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Daily Routine does not integrate with or send data to any third-party analytics, SDKs, or advertising services.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since all data is stored locally, your information is as secure as your device itself.
    We recommend enabling device security features such as a screen lock or encryption.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on this page.
  </p>
